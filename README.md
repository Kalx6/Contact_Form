# Contact Form Project

## Description

This project is a **Contact Form** built with **React** and **TypeScript**, styled with plain **CSS**.  
It leverages **React Hook Form** for easy and effective form management and validation.

The form includes:

- Required field validation that shows error messages if inputs are empty.
- Email validation that detects invalid email formats and displays appropriate error messages.

As a junior developer, Iâ€™m proud of this project as it demonstrates my ability to build clean, accessible, and user-friendly forms using modern React practices.
